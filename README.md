# herbie-old

This was my first attempt at creating a chat program, it takes user input  in the form of text and after a time tries to form a sensible reply from that information.

Herbie requires the nltk python module and it may be helpful to run 'python -m nltk.downloader all' to make sure all the grammar and references are ready. Also the tkinter gui module is needed.
